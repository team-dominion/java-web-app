<h1 align="center"> Welcome to Team Dominion...
    We want to thank Prof Legah and Prof Ken of LandMark Technology for their relentless efforts to carry us 
    through this perilous journey right to the very end. Special thanks also goes to our 
    team lead Dr. Forseh (Mola) who also saw to it that we remain focused in our studies. A Special shout 
    out to our team members: 
    - Dr. Dasime 
    - Beatrice 
    - Jane 
    - Lonje 
    Its been a very long journey (6 months seems like 6 years) and finally the journey is coming to an end. 
    Our prayer remains the same: "Everyone in Team Dominion as well as the entire class24 will be HIRED!!!"
    Amen and Amen...
